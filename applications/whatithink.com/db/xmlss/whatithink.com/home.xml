    <p>The world always makes the assumption that the exposure of an error is identical with the
        discovery of truth - that the error and truth are simply opposite.  They are nothing of the sort.
        What the world turns to, when it is cured on one error, is usually simply another error, and maybe
        one worse than the first one. <i> ~ H.L. Mencken</i>

    <p>Proverbs often contradict one another, as any reader soon discovers.  The sagacity that
        advises us to look before we leap promptly warns us that if we hesitate we are lost; that
        absence makes the heart grow fonder, but out of sight, out of mind.  <i> ~ Leo Rosten</i>

        We are all but recent leaves on the same old tree of life and if this life has adapted itself
        to new functions and conditions, it uses the same old basic principles over and over again.
        There is no real difference between the grass and the man who mows it. <i> ~ Albert Szent-Gyorgyi</i>
